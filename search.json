    "section": "",
    "text": "Recall that a zonotope is a polytope all whose faces are centrally symmetric. Equivalently (though not trivially so) zonotopes can be defined as Minkowski sums of line segments.\nA polytope is inscribed if all its vertices lie on a sphere.\nBoth zonotopes and inscribed polytopes are abundant, but it turns out that asking for both at the same time is surprisingly restrictive. In fact, only 17 are known in dimension three (+ an infinite family of prisms), yet we can’t even show that there are finitely many (ignoring the prisms). But let’s move slowly.\nSome examples come to mind easily: the cube, prisms, and perhaps even the permutahedron. All those actually share a property much stronger than being inscribed: they are vertex-transitive, that is, their orthogonal symmetry group acts transitively on the vertices.\n…\nIn [1] I showed the vertex those are exactly the \\(\\Gamma\\)-permutahedra, where \\(\\Gamma\\) is a finite reflection group.\nA vertex-transitive zonotope might have realizations that are inscribed but not vertex-transitive. For example, the \\(A_3\\)-zonotope can be realized as an inscribed zonotope with any of the following generators:\n\\[\\alpha_i\\alpha_j (\\alpha_i e_j-\\alpha_j e_i)\\]\nIn contrast, the \\(H_3\\)-zonotope can be realized as an inscribed zonotope in exactly one way, which is then vertex-transitive.\nSanyal and Manecke noted that the projection of an isncribed zonotope along an edge direction yields again an inscribed zonotope. Starting from higher-dimensional \\(\\Gamma\\)-permutahedra this gives rise to many inscribed zonotopes of new combinatorial types. I like to call them quasi-permutahedra. All in all they found 17 combinatorial types for which they generated the graphics below.\nThey also gave the following diagram showing the realtios between the different quasi-permutahedra.\nIt should be noted that all inscribed zonotopes are simple, that is, their graph is regular and the degree is exactly the dimension. As such, the hyperplane arrangement that corresponds the the zonotope (i.e. the arrangement whose normal vectors are the edge directions) is simplicial. Simplicial hyperplane arrangements are a beast on their own and form their own exclusive club. The “trivial” examples are the reflection arrangements. The most up-to-date list in dimension three is due to Grünbaum and Cuntz and list 93 arrangements + 3 infinite families. Sanyal and Manecke verified that only the quasi-reflection arrangements (the ones obtained by restriction of a reflection arrangements to a hyperplane) lead to inscribed zonotopes (on the way they verified that all the known arrangements are projectively unique!). They did however find that some arrangements lead to strange “zonotope-like” objects that are inscribed not in a sphere, but a different quadric!"

This class of convex bodies is in the literature better known as unconditional bodies. I am unsure about the origin of this term, and I tend to dislike it since it is seems the opposite of self-explanatory.\nA coordinate-symmetric corner is the restriction of a coordinate symmetric body to the positive orthant \\(\\Bbb R_+:=\\{(x_1,...,x_n)\\in\\Bbb R^n\\mid x_i\\ge 0\\}\\). Since every coordinate-symmetric body consists of \\(2^n\\) coordinate-symmetric corners, one can proof their Mahler conjecture by proving the following:\nThe statement of the Mahler conjecture for antiblocking polytopes reduces to\n\\[M_+(P_+):=\\operatorname{vol}(P_+)\\cdot\\operatorname{vol}(P_+^*) \\ge 1/d!\\]\nA fairly short inductive proof goes as follows: let \\(P_i:=P_+\\cap\\{x_i=0\\}\\) and \\(P_i^*:=P_+^*\\cap \\{x_i=0\\}\\), which are antiblocking. Define vectors \\(v,v^*\\in\\Bbb R^d\\) by\n\\[ v_i := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+)},\\quad\\; v_i^* := \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i^*)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+^*)}\\]\nFor a point \\(x\\in \\Bbb R_+^d\\) the inner product \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle\\) evaluates to\n\\[\n\\langle x,v\\rangle\n= \\sum_{i=1}^d x_i\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}{d \\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)}\n= \\frac1{\\operatorname{vol}_{d}(P_+)} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^d \\underbrace{\\tfrac1d{x_i \\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)}}_{\\operatorname{vol}_d(C_i)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_i\\) is the cone with base face \\(P_i\\) and cone point \\(x\\). If \\(x\\in P_+\\) then the cones \\(C_i\\) have disjoint interiors and are contained in \\(P_+\\). In particular, the sum of their volumes is bounded by \\(\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)\\). Therefore \\(\\langle x,v\\rangle \\le 1\\) for all \\(x\\in P_+\\), and hence \\(v\\in P_+^*\\). By an analogous argument holds \\(v^*\\in P_+\\). In particular,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1\\ge &\\langle v,v^*\\rangle\n=  \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i)\\operatorname{vol}_{d-1}(P_i^*)}{d^2\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+)\\operatorname{vol}_d(P_+^*)}\n= \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{M_+(P_i)}{d^2M_+(P_+)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy rearranging and applying the induction hypothesis \\(M_+(P_i)\\ge 1/(d-1)!\\) we conclude\n\\[\nM_+(P_+) \\ge \\frac1{d^2} \\sum_{i=1}^d M_+(P_i) \\ge \\frac1{d^2} \\cdot\\frac{d}{(d-1)!} = \\frac1{d!}.\n\\]\nThis prove was first shown to me by Raman Sanyal.

Besides their geometric nature as convex sets, polytopes possess a rich combinatorial structure, making them exceptionally accessible by combinatorial techniques. The study of polytopes reaches from the antiquity (starting from the Platonic solids), over the 19th/20th century (understanding polytopes in 3D and initializing the study of polytopes in dimension \\(\\ge 3\\)), until today, where we understand that the richness of polytopal phenomena starts in dimension 4 and which led to findings such as universality. The subject has shown proximity to algebraic geometry, representation theory, analysis, optimization and many more.\n\n\nScope\nIn this course I aimed to give an overview of this very diverse subject and cover selected topics with focus towards research and open questions.
