My main mathematical interest is Geometry in all of its forms, most actively, discrete, algebraic, convex and computational geometry, also touching on many aspects of graph theory, topology and representation theory.\nI am principal investigator in the priority program “Combinatorial Synergies”. My project “Wachspress Coordinates - a Bridge betwen Algebra, Geometry and Combinatorics” will be conducted at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig (Germany), starting April 2025.\nmartin.h.winter@warwick.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch interests\nI work(ed) and published on\n\npolyhedral combinatorics and geometry,\ngraph theory (spectral, algebraic, geometric and topological),\nrigidity theory, geometric constraint system and real algebraic geometry,\nlow-dimensional topology (knot theory, embeddings and embeddability of graphs and complexes, …)\nsymmetries of discrete and geometric objects,\nfinite group theory and real representation theory,\nalgebraic combinatorics (association schemes, distance regular graphs, codes …),\nconvex geometry,\nrandom structures and graph limits,\ndiscrete dynamical systems, …"
